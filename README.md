# Dockerium

Dockerium is my own version of Docker that I made using Golang. I did this for two main reasons:

1. I wanted to learn Golang.
2. I wanted to understand how Docker works behind the scenes.

## Usage

To use Dockerium, follow these steps:

1. Build the binary:

```
make build
```

2. Run the project with the desired image name:

```

This will fetch the image layers and extract them for you to use.
